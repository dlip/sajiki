This frantic last man standing platformer style game is great fun for casual gamers of all ages.
 The aim of the game is to be the only man standing. To do this you must capture the Time 
 Dilation Device [TDD] before anyone else does and hold it long enough to outlast the other 
 players. Don't fall in the traps and find the rotations switches to rotate the entire level 
 any direction to send other people to their doom!! Players start with 120 seconds health at 
 the end of this time they will die. The TDD pauses your personal countdown timer.
 
 Controls (Movement/Attack):
 Player 1: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT/Right Control
 Player 2: WASD/Left Control
 Player 3: IJKL/Space
 Player 4: NUMPAD 8456/Enter
